# Exercitiu
Simple exercise
There are 2 java files. Both are very simple web automation tests.
Invalid_password is a test case in which a wrong password is introduced and the error is shown as "Invalid Password"
Invalid_email_format is a test case in which a wrong email is introduced and the error is shown as "Invalid email format"
The tests were performed in Eclipse by using Selenium webdriver with Java.
